        <p>Figure skating is one of the most watched events during the winter Olympics. It is a sport that involves skating on very thin blades across a layer of ice. There are four disciplines that are included in the Olympic games. They are women's singles, men's singles, ice dance, and pairs. There are more disciples in figure skating that are not in the Olympic games, they include synchronized skating, theatre on ice, and more. Competitions for each figure skating level is done and is enjoyed by all. Shows are also very popular and are for audience enjoyment and for the performers to have fun showing the sport that they love.</p>

        <h2>The Beginning of the Sport</h2>   
            <p>Figure skating has been around for centuries, but the first book detailing figure skating was <em>A Treatise on Skating</em> published in 1772. At this time figure skating was a very formal type of skating. Then in the mid-1860's, American <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Haines target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jackson Haines</a> introcued a new style of figure skating which involved free moveemnts and jumps on the ice. Haines style of figure skating caught on in Europe but the United States did not accept it until he had been dead for many years.</p>
           
            <p>In the early 1900's, Americans Irving Brokaw and George H. Browne, helped bring and normalize Haines style to the United States. Organizations started forming in the States and other countries. Years prior in 1892, the Netherlands founded the <a href="https://www.isu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Skating Union</a> (ISU). The ISU was to manage all skating done internationally. Then in 1921, the <a href="https://www.usfigureskating.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States Figure Skating Association</a> (USFSA) was founded with only <strong>seven</strong> figure skating clubs across the nation. Today they now have <strong>over 750</strong> clubs.</p>
            
        <h2>Notable Contributors to Modern Figure Skating</h2> 
            <h3>Louis Rubenstein</h3>
                <p>Louis Rubenstein was instrumental in the develpoment of modern figure skating. Rubenstein led the effort to formalize tests and competitions. He did this by establishing governing bodies for skating in the United States and Canada. He also helped organize the Amateur Skating Association of Canada, which is not called Skate Canada, and the National Amateur Skating Association of the United States. The National Amateur Skating Association of the United States was the predecessor of USFSA. </p>
            
            <h3>Madge Syers</h3>
                <p>Madge Syers was the first woman to participate in a World Championshop event. This was in 1902 when she competed. The rules did not specifiy sex of competitors, therefore Syers entered the World Championship and got second in the competition. The following year, ISU rules were changed to specify that women could not compete in the men's category, but the women's category.</p>
            
            <h3>Dick Button</h3>
                <p>Dick Button is known as the great American male star of the 20th century. He won five world titles, two Olympic gold medals, and seven U.S. national championships. Button was the first skater to land a double axel in competition. He did this at the 1948 Winter Olympics that were held in St. Moritz, Switzerland. </p>
            
            <h3>Karl Schäfer</h3>
                <p>Karl Schäfer introduced new elements to the sport that involved spinning rapidly on one foot while in an upright position. This spin is now called a "scratch spin". </p>
